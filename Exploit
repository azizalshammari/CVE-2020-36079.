Zenphoto through 1.5.7 is affected by authenticated arbitrary file
upload, leading to remote code execution. The attacker must navigate to
the uploader plugin, check the elFinder box, and then drag and drop
files into the Files(elFinder) portion of the UI. This can, for
example, place a .php file in the server's uploaded/ directory.
